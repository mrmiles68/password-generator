This project creates randomized passcodes for users to increase security.



Having an automated and random password generator creates passwords that are
much more difficult to crack vs passwords created by users.

Users can jump in right away, following the prompts to get the information they need!

Any users with issues can email mrmiles68@yahoo.com for assistance.
